              <p>
                During your usage of the App, some third parties may also provide us with certain information about you.
                Typically, this includes your friends on our App, who automatically deliver your phone number(s) when
                they contact you. Similarly, any profile detail, including your name, phone number, or any other
                personal detail made public by you will be storable or usable by other users of the App. Any message
                sent to other users using the service will also be available to them for use in whichever way they like.
                It is, therefore, your responsibility not to disclose anything that may be sensitive to you in nature.
              </p>
              <p>Similarly, when you involve a third-party service on our App, say to share some of your Comera
                activities over their platform, we may receive some of the data those services may have of you. Further,
                for our marketing and commercial requirements, a part of the profiling done on the user may be shared
                with a third-party vendor to optimize the resources invested. Please note that the privacy policies and
                terms of such third-parties govern the usage of shared information, and not of Comera’s. </p>
              <p>We do not store your messages or communications. If you decide of your own to store your Comera
                messages on third party cloud storages (like Google Drive or iCloud) please be informed that in such
                cases, the privacy policies and terms of use of such third-party services come into effect when you use
                their services. </p>
              <p>We may share your data once consent is given by you to our sister companies or if we go for a merger or
                organizational restructure. </p>
              <p>We ensure your personal data is protected by requiring all our group companies to follow the same rules
                when processing your personal data. These rules are called "binding corporate rules". </p>

                If you are based in the European Economic Area (EEA), many of our external third parties are based

              <p>
                Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the country of your residence, we ensure a similar degree
                of protection is afforded to it by ensuring that such service providers give us a written undertaking
                that they will give personal data the same protection it has in the EEA and in this privacy policy.

              </div>
              <p>
                Since our App deals extensively with the exchange of information, we understand how vital it is to
                safeguard that information. For that, we have placed the best security protocols in the structure of the
                App, including end-to-end encryption for your messages. <span class="highlight">End-to-end encryption
                  means that nobody, except the generator of the message and the intended receiver, will have the access
                  to your private conversations.</span> The protocol also covers end-to-end encrypted one-on-one calls
                so that no unintended third-party can eavesdrop.
              </p>
              <p>
                All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Where we send you an OTP (which is
                temporary and valid only for a limited time), you are responsible for keeping this OTP confidential. We
                ask you not to share this temporary OTP with anyone.
              </p>
              <p>Once we have received your information, we will use reasonable procedures and security features to try
                to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way.</p>
              <p>Your Data is stored directly on your own Device storage.</p>
              <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and
                any applicable regulator when we are legally required to do so.</p>
              <p>If any time in future we add the payment features to our App (in which case you will be informed in
                advance), any payment transactions carried out by us or our chosen third-party provider of payment
                processing services will be encrypted using appropriate encryption technology.</p>

                store your data on any of our servers beyond that period.</p>
              <p>However, law might require us to keep some basic information about our customers including Contact,
                Identity etc. In such conditions, we are bound to comply with laws and if we do so, we will keep the
                minimum possible data and for the shortest possible time as prescribed by law .</p>
              <p>Your messages, which our end-to-end encryption services secure by encrypting them (including chats,
                calls, and multimedia content like photos, videos, and voice messages), remain in our system up to the
                point of delivery, which is a maximum of 7 days. Your device, however, may independently accumulate sent
                and received messages. To know more about how your chat is made secure, read the section on ‘Data
                Security’. </p>
              <p>In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with
