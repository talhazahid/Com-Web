            Comera - Privacy Policy

          <p>
            When you trust Comera for your free calling and messaging needs, you share certain information about you with us. We remain committed to the privacy and protection of all that data and therefore, explain here in transparent terms how we do so.
          </p> 

          <p>
            By using Comera, which allows you to communicate through calls and messages over the internet, along with sharing of multimedia/files, (collectively also referred in the document as ‘We’, ‘Services’, ‘The App’), you (‘User’) acknowledge and agree to the terms and policies stated in this document. You also agree that these policies apply to all the information you provide us periodically throughout your usage of the app. The stated policies will also govern any information collected either through your doing or through the initiatives of third-party.

            Storage of Information 
          </div>

          <p>
            To set up an account over Comera and to use that account, the app would ask for certain permissions from the user. Some of these requests will pop-up during the registration process, while others will appear during your usage of the app. Only when the user approves these requests, does the app perform the desired action and handle the relevant user data. The specific details of this are below: 
          </p>

            Account Details 
          </div>

          <p>
            These are primarily the credentials you feed the app to register an account. Typically, this includes nothing more than the following:            
          </p>      
          
          <ul>
            <li>Your name </li>
            <li>Operational phone number </li>
            <li>Profile picture (Optional) </li>
          </ul>

          <p>Besides this, any other information that you may enter at this stage to set up your profile will also get logged into the system.  </p>

Your device, however, may independently accumulate sent and received messages. To know more about how your chat is made secure, read the section on ‘Security Protocols’.

The call log will show you the entire call history including the date and timestamps. Essentially, this is to help you instantly connect with those who you have recently been in contact with or the people you love to talk to the most to overall improve your Comera experience.

            During your usage of the app, some third parties may also provide us with certain information about you. Typically, this includes your friends on Comera, who automatically deliver your phone number(s) when they contact you. Similarly, any profile detail, including your name, phone number, or any other personal detail made public by you will be storable or usable by other Comera users. Any message sent to other users using the service will also be available to them for use in whichever way they like. It is, therefore, your responsibility to not disclose people anything that may be sensitive to you in nature.

              Similarly, when you involve a third-party service on Comera, say to share some of your Comera activities over their platform, we may receive some of the data those services may have of you. Lastly, for our marketing and commercial requirements, a part of the profiling done on the user may be shared with a third-party vendor to optimize the resources invested. Please note that the privacy policies and terms of such third-parties govern the usage of shared information, and not of Comera’s.

            Since Comera deals extensively with the exchange of information, we understand how imperative it is to safeguard that information. For that, we have placed the best security protocols in the structure of the app, including end-to-end encryption for your messages. End-to-end encryption means that nobody, except the generator of the message and the intended receiver, will have the access to your private conversations. The protocol also covers one-on-one and conference calls so that no unintended third-party can eavesdrop.
